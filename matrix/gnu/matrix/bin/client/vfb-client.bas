1.3 Matrices
A matrix is a rectangular or two-dimensional array. We speak of the rows and
columns of a matrix. The rows or columns can be considered to be vectors,
and we often use this equivalence. An n Ã— m matrix is one with n rows and
m columns. The number of rows and the number of columns determine the
